              <p><strong>For UF students in my courses:</strong> The best way to contact me is meeting me directly in office hours or messaging via Slack. I will not reply to emails that consist of course-related requests.</p>

                <strong>[Waiver of Pre-requisites]</strong> The department has a strict policy on not waiving prerequisites. So you will not be able to take COP3530, if you haven't completed COP3503 and COT3100. Concurrent enrollment with pre-requisites is not allowed.

              <p>If you are a UF student, the best way to meet me is at office hours. I will be holding office hours virtually over Zoom. You can discuss course and career related questions. Also, I would be happy to discuss pretty much anything only if we do not have long lines.</p>
              
              <p>These office hours are based on a community-based model (idea influenced by <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/office-hours.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="standard-link">Philip Guo</a> and <a href="https://d.ucsd.edu/srk/faq/#meet" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="standard-link">Scott Klemmer</a>) which means I hold office hours together for students across different courses and academic years.</p>
              
              <p>If you want to discuss something more privately, either tell me during office hours so that we can go to a break-out room or send me a slack message or email to setup time to meet.</p>

            <div class="card-content">
              <p>If you were an undergraduate student researcher or TA working under my supervision or a student enrolled in one of my courses, and if you would like me to write a Letter of Recommendation for you, reach out to me on <a href="mailto:kapooramanpreet@ufl.edu" class="standard-link">my email</a> and complete <a href="https://forms.gle/VHVZ9fWyPGm8MuTK7" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="standard-link">this form at least <strong>three weeks</strong> before the deadline.</a></p>
              
              <p><strong>Important:</strong> I can only write the letter if I know you personally and we had interactions beyond the class. That is because I write highly personalized letters. If you are one of the students I never interacted with throughout the course or if you scored a grade below B, I <strong>will not</strong> be able to write you a strong recommendation letter. A generic letter will not help you with your application and I recommend reaching out to others who you know more personally and can evaluate you better.</p>
