                If you are a UF student, the best way to meet me is at office hours.
                I will be holding office hours virtually over Zoom during Fall 2021.
                You can discuss course and career related questions. Also, I would be
                happy to discuss pretty much anything only if we do not have long
                lines. These office hours are based on a community-based model
                (idea influenced by <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/office-hours.htm"
                class="standard-link"> Philip Guo </a> and
                <a href="https://d.ucsd.edu/srk/faq/#meet"
                class="standard-link"> Scott Klemmer</a>)
                which means I hold office hours together for students across different courses
                and academic years.
              </div>
              <div class="standard-para">
                If you want to discuss something more privately, either tell me during
                office hours so that we can go to a break-out room or send me a slack message
                or email to setup time to meet. I can meet Monday-Friday, 9 am - 5 pm based on
                my availability:
